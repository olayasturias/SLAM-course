Python Jupyter notebooks with examples of code based in the content of Cyrill's SLAM course. More info in [my blog](https://olayasturias.github.io/)


## Extended Kalman Filter

Implementation of the Extended Kalman Filter using an Odometry motion model and laser range measurements in a 2D environment. [Link to the jupyter notebook.](https://github.com/olayasturias/SLAM-course/blob/main/EFK_SLAM.ipynb)

## Particle Filter

First, a simple implementation of the most basic aspects of a particle filter are implemented in [this notebook.](https://github.com/olayasturias/SLAM-course/blob/main/ParticleFilterBasics.ipynb) Here, we can see how to perform an update of the samples based in the odometry model, and how to perform the resampling with the "Low Variance Sampling" method.
